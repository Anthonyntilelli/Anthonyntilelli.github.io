I have been fortunate, to have worked for a variety of companies, ranging from technology-focused to having technology as the driver of their actual focus. When speaking to those around me, and talking about the work they have done, I more often heard about the parts they did not get to add or the error in the project.  Interestingly, the people who project are the most impressive, seemed to be the most affected.  That one more feature or we can do better feeling can drag a project for a long time and be essentially tempting when working on a project you are invested in.
